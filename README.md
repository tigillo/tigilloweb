# Art Around 1900

Hey, guys!

[Art Around 1900](https://art1900.info) is a collection for Art Nouveau architecture. I do believe Art Nouveau has an important place in art history. I'll probably always be a big fan of those truly imaginative artistic buildings.

Bartosz T. Zalewski, the previous owner of the domain really made a good job. I tried to extend his collection by some technology, adding details about the buildings and embedding street view for each. Now it's time to extend the collection. I think it is really clear that there is a huge amount of good work that was done in a very stylized way and lots of masterpieces missing on this web site. Please feel free to [contribute](https://art1900.info/contribute.html) for extending the collection.

Made with love by Mehmet @maayd_in. Thanks for your support!
