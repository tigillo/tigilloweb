Hey, guys!

This website is a collection of Art Nouveau architecture around the world. I do believe Art Nouveau has an important place in art history. I'll probably always be a big fan of those truly imaginative artistic buildings.

Bartosz T. Zalewski, the previous owner of the domain name (art1900.info) really made a good job. I tried to extend his collection by some technology, adding details about the buildings and embedding street view for each. Now it's time to extend the collection. I think it is really clear that there is a huge amount of good work that was done in a very stylized way and lots of masterpieces missing on this web site. Please feel free to [contribute]({{site.baseurl}}/contribute) for extending the collection.
