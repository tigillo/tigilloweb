*{{site.companyname}}* is committed to the principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the abolition of modern slavery and human trafficking.

As an equal opportunities employer, we're committed to creating and ensuring a non-discriminatory and respectful working environment for our staff. We want all our staff to feel confident that they can expose wrongdoing without any risk to themselves.

Our recruitment and people management processes are designed to ensure that all prospective employees are legally entitled to work in the UK and to safeguard employees from any abuse or coercion.

We do not enter into business with any organisation, in the UK or abroad, which knowingly supports or is found to be involved in slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour.

Our supply chains are limited and we procure goods and services from a restricted range of UK and overseas suppliers, mainly through UK government frameworks.

#### Embedding the principles

We will continue to embed the principles through:

- providing awareness training to staff on the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and informing them of the appropriate action to take if they suspect a case of slavery or human trafficking

- ensuring staff involved in procurement activity are aware of and follow [modern slavery procurement guidance on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/procurement-policy-note-0519-tackling-modern-slavery-in-government-supply-chains)

- ensuring that consideration of the modern slavery risks and prevention are added to *{{site.companyname}}*'s policy review process as an employer and procurer of goods and services
