The most architecturally interesting objects in Szczecin can be found on Wały Chrobrego. The buildings erected here after 1901, in the style of historicism, refer to Baroque, North German mannerism. Others, such as the Maritime Museum and the Contemporary Theater, were built in the style of Art Nouveau and Modernism. The embankments are complemented by observation terraces with stairs, as well as a fountain and sculptures referring to the culture of ancient Egypt or Rome, made by German masters

The center of Szczecin is characterized by large roundabouts and streets, along which there are several-storey, eclectic tenements. This starry urban layout is often compared to the most famous implementation of this type in Europe - Paris. Most of Śródmieście was built on a star-like layout with roundabout squares and wide avenues with trees. The majority of tram routes run in separate lanes or in the middle of the avenue.

A characteristic element of the streets of Szczecin are cast-iron pumps from the second half of the 19th century. They were manufactured in the local company of F. Poepcke. They served as a backup source of water for the city's inhabitants. They proved to be very useful during World War II and in the first years after the war, when the water supply system was not fully operational. To date, approximately 30 pumps (of 70) have survived. The pumps are richly decorated (channeled column, city coats of arms, crown on the top), and the water outflow occurs from the stylized dragon's mouth.
