                <p><strong>CI/CD pipeline development</strong> allows you to deliver software solutions in a short period of time by automating the building, testing, and deploying processes of your software, allowing it to be pushed into production at breakneck speed.</p>
                <p>Digital transformation and modern software development have propelled businesses to continuously push softwares to production with the latest features, updates, and additions. If done manually or on-premise, this process will take up a lot of time and effort.</p>

                <p>Continuous integration collects codes from various sources worldwide, tests them simultaneously for potential bugs, fixes flaws, retests, and then sends them to production, also known as continuous delivery. As a result, new features can be deployed more quickly with less time and effort.</p>
                <p>Our dedicated team at Tigillo provides continuous integration and continuous delivery services by efficiently developing a CI/CD pipeline using AWS, Azure continuous integration services, and other open-source CI/CD services. </p>
