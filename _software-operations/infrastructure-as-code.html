                <p>To achieve Infrastructure as Code, we use various server automation and configuration management tools such as Terraform, Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Salt, with Terraform as our primary tool for providing Infrastructure as Code services.</p>
                <p>In this era of cloud computing with multiple application releases, the number of infrastructure components has grown. It is critical to have an Infrastructure as Code methodology in place to manage this large-scale infrastructure that can scale up and down and be adjusted at any time.</p>
