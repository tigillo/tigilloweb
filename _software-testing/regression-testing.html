                <p>Our <strong>regression testing services</strong> will verify the new features or modifications in the software and make sure that the original functionalities of the software remain unaffected.
                </p>
                <p>With regression testing, we identify if any harmful bugs are introduced to the existing code base due to functional enhancements, bug fixes, releases, and patches and whether any of these modifications eliminated previously existing errors.
